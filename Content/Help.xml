  <Topic Title="爬楼梯">
    梯子可以用木棒合成。
    放置在垂直墙壁上的梯子可以让你轻松地攀爬。
    \n\n
    最安全的攀爬方式是正面对着梯子，
    无论是向上爬还是向下爬。
    \n\n
    因此，最好的爬下梯子的方法是后退着到达梯子，就像你在现实生活中做的那样。
    \n\n
    你随时可以从梯子上跳下来。

  <Topic Title="骑动物">
    你可以骑一些特定的动物，比如马和骆驼。
    骑上动物后你可以更快地移动，而且你的视点会更高。
    \n\n
    要骑一只动物，你要先接近它，并等它静止在一个地方。
    这是潜行按钮会变成骑乘按钮。
    按下骑乘按钮可以骑上一只动物或者从动物上下来。
    \n\n
    要成功地骑一只动物，你需要一个鞍。鞍可以用皮和木棒合成。
    动物加上了鞍后，其行为会改变，而且会对你更加友好。
    \n\n
    不要骑一只没有鞍的动物，它不会喜欢你那样做的。

  <Topic Title="Hunger">
    You need to eat to stay alive.
    If you don't eat for a long time, your character will start complaining about it and eventually losing health, until he dies.
    In addition to that, if you're hungry, you don't regenerate health.
    \n\n
    To eat, drag an edible item to the eat rectangle in the body panel.
    Your character will inform you whether he is still hungry.
    \n\n
    Food can be obtained from many sources in the game.
    The obvious one is hunting edible animals, such as cows, birds and wildboars.
    Keep in mind that hunting may be dangerous, and the supply of animals will quickly dry up in nearby areas, forcing you to search further.
    \n\n
    An alternative to hunting is farming.
    Farming lets you create a sustainable source of food, although it may require lots of preparatory work and further maintenance.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Stamina">
    Your character is not infinitely strong.
    When you perform a tiring action for a long time without break, you will tire and start panting.
    \n\n
    When you are panting, your performance is lower than when you are rested.
    You will move and dig slower, and you will not be able to perform high jumps.
    \n\n
    Some of the actions that are tiring: running, jumping, swimming, digging.
    \n\n
    It is especially dangerous to get tired when you are in water, because you can't rest while swimming.
    Watch for early signs of panting, and get out of water immediately.
    When you get exhausted while in water, you will start drowning and die unless the shore is very near.
    \n\n
    Be careful, it's easy to get tired when running away from dangerous animals.
    This can have fatal consequences for obvious reasons.

  <Topic Title="Digging Blocks">
    In Survivalcraft, the entire world is destructible.
    \n\n
    To dig a block, press it and hold your finger.
    A digging progress circle will appear.
    \n\n
    Some blocks take a very long time to dig without proper tools. 
    Digging some blocks, such as glass, will destroy them.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Placing Blocks">
    To place a block, select it from your inventory so that you are holding it in your hand.
    Then tap the face of an existing block, where you want the new block to be attached.
    The block will be placed there immediately, unless it is impossible for some reason.
    \n\n
    Certain items behave differently if attached to different parts of an existing block.
    For example, trapdoors can be attached to the top or bottom parts with different results.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Interacting With Blocks">
    Certain blocks are interactive.
    Some examples of interactive blocks: doors, chests, crafting tables, furnaces, buttons.
    \n\n
    To interact with a block, tap on it.
    This will invoke the action associated with the block.
    \n\n
    For example, if you tap on a closed door, it will open.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Throwing Items">
    Certain items can be thrown.
    Some examples of throwable items: stone chunks, spears, bricks, snowballs.
    \n\n
    To throw an item, select it in your inventory, so that you are holding it in your hand.
    Press and hold a point on the screen where you want to throw.
    A throwing sights will appear.
    \n\n
    You can move the sights to refine your aim.
    Once you release your finger, the item will be thrown.
    To cancel a throw, move the sights to the edge of the screen.
    \n\n
    Spears are powerful thrown weapons that do a lot of damage when they hit the target.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Dropping Items">
    All items and blocks can be dropped if you no longer need them.
    \n\n
    To drop an item or block, drag it from the inventory slot and drop it on the screen.
    The item will fly a short distance away and fall to the ground.
    \n\n
    Watch out, if you're standing too close you will immediately pick up the dropped item again.
    \n\n
    Dropping items into fire or magma will destroy them.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Crafting">
    Crafting is a process of making more complicated items out of simpler ones, using a crafting table or the crafting area.
    \n\n
    To craft, you need to place ingredients in the crafting slots in a pattern specific to the item being crafted.
    All crafting recipes are available in RECIPAEDIA.
    \n\n
    There are two sizes of crafting areas: 2x2 and 3x3.
    The smaller area is always available and can be accessed by pressing the crafting button.
    To craft more complicated items on a 3x3 area you need to make a crafting table, place it somewhere in the world and click on it.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Smelting">
    Smelting is thermal processing of substances in a furnace.
    Up to 2 substances can be placed in the furnace at the same time.
    \n\n
    Furnace requires fuel to work.
    You can use anything that is combustible as a fuel, but some fuels are better (longer lasting) than others.
    The best fuel is coal.
    \n\n
    You can leave the furnace while it is smelting. The smelting process will continue while you are away.
    All smelting recipes are available in RECIPAEDIA.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Splitting stacks of items">
    Press and hold the slot containing the stack you want to split for about 1 second.
    A red border will appear around it.
    The slot is now in splitting mode.
    Tap any other empty slot, and one item will be taken from the highlighted slot and placed into the tapped slot.
    \n\n
    This technique can also be used to quickly spread items from one stack to multiple slots, e.g. in a crafting table.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Mining">
    You need to mine to obtain resources needed for crafting and smelting.
    Mining can be as simple as digging in a random place with your bare hands.
    You will however soon discover that it is not an effective way to mine, because digging hard rock by hand takes a very long time.
    \n\n
    You need to craft mining tools, such as a shovel and pickaxe first.
    You also need to dig in different places to find specific resources.
    Caves are a good starting point, because they show you a large cross section through the terrain for free.
    \n\n
    Be aware that some resources, such as diamonds or malachite, require tools made of strong materials to be mined.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Farming">
    Farming allows you to grow a variety of plants for decorative or consumption purposes.
    To grow a plant, you need to obtain its seeds, usually from a fully grown plant specimen.
    \n\n
    Some plants will drop seeds immediately when they are harvested, some will require crafting to extract seeds.
    Some seeds will tolerate poor soil, like dirt or grass.
    Others, like rye or pumpkins, require high quality tilled and moist soil, which has been fertilized with saltpeter.
    To make sure the soil is moist, use bucket to create water channels no further than several blocks away.
    Moist soil is darker than a dry one.
    To further enhance soil quality, sprinkle it with saltpeter (which is a source of nitrogen).
    \n\n
    Plants may take a long time to grow, be patient.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Buckets">
    Buckets are used for transporting fluids, such as water or magma.
    To fill empty bucket with a fluid, you need to find a source block of the fluid.
    For example, all ocean blocks are source blocks of water.
    \n\n
    Holding the empty bucket in your hand, tap the source block to collect it.
    The block will be removed from the world and placed inside the bucket.
    \n\n
    To pour the fluid from the bucket, tap on terrain.
    A new source block of fluid will be created, and the fluid will spread out from there.
    You can collect the placed source block again with the empty bucket.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Dyeing and Painting">
    Some blocks and items can be dyed or painted.
    \n\n
    To paint bricks, stone, wood or other blocks, make a paint bucket of appropriate color and use it on the item you want to paint.
    One bucket is good for painting several dozen blocks, after that it runs out.
    \n\n
    To dye clothing, place a piece of clothing with a bucket full of paint in a furnace.
    You can dye clothing multiple times, combining colors.

  <Topic Title="Electricity">
	Electricity is a powerful mechanism in the game that can be used to control behavior of certain blocks.
	For example, a lightbulb will produce light when connected to a source of electricity, doors will open or close if activated with an electric signal, and many more.
    \n\n
	If you know a bit about real-world electronics, you should feel at home in Survivalcraft.
	All the familiar devices, such as logic gates (AND, OR, NOT etc.) are present and signals are characterized by voltage.
	You can combine gates to build complex circuits, even computers or video games (check Community Content for some great builds by master electricians).
	There are also sensors, such as pressure plates, photodiodes etc. that produce varying signals depending on conditions around them.
    \n\n
	For descriptions of all available electric devices, check RECIPAEDIA.
    \n\n
	Electric signals in the game are conducted through copper wires and have a voltage that is between 0V and 1.5V, in increments of 0.1V.
	This gives 16 distinct voltage values.
    \n\n
	Digital devices, such as buttons, lightbulbs or doors work only with digital signals that have two possible values: low (0, false, off, no) and high (1, true, on, yes).
	In this case, a voltage below 0.8V indicates low, 0.8V and greater indicates high.
	Most commonly digital signals have voltages of 0V for low and 1.5V for high, but any value below 0.8V will be read as low.
    \n\n
	Analog devices, such as pressure plates or motion detectors work with analog signals.
	They will react to each different value of voltage between 0 and 1.5V, not just low and high states.
	For example, sound generator volume and pitch inputs are controlled by analog voltages.
	The volume and pitch will increase smoothly as the voltages get higher.
    \n\n
	It's good to remember that both analog and digital signals are really the same thing when conducted through the wire, a voltage between 0V and 1.5V.
	Only the way a device interprets the signal's voltage determines whether it is digital or analog.
    \n\n
	Voltage can also be interpreted as a number, with 0V representing 0 and 1.5V representing 15.
	Some devices, such as displays, DAC/ADC converters or counters use this interpretation.
    \n\n
	All electric devices have connections (inputs and outputs) on their sides, and sometimes also on their back (the face attached to the wall).
	On complex devices these are indicated by blue and red dots on edges of the elements.
	Blue means input, red means output.
	Number of dots means number of the connection.
	Simple devices, such as buttons, switches or lightbulbs do not have these dots, because they use one input/output only and can be connected from any side.
    \n\n
	Electric devices can be placed on the walls, and sometimes also on the floor/ceiling. 
	Once placed, they can be rotated so that it's easy to connect appropriate inputs and outputs together with the wires.
    \n\n
	There is a special type of block in the game, called wire-though-block, which is a normal block with a hole drilled and an electric wire threaded though it.
	It is very useful when trying to hide wires from sight, run them though the wall, or prevent them from connecting with other wires.
	It is also the only way to access the "back" connection of devices which have it.
	\n\n
	Electricity in Survivalcraft is processed at a frequency of 100Hz.
	It means that voltage goes from one element to another in 0.01s, irrespective of the length of the wire.
	If you need to delay the signal, you may place some neutral elements in its path (for example an OR gate or a pair of NOT gates).
	Each additional element in the way of the signal will delay it by 0.01s.
	For longer delays use Delay Gate, which can produce very long delays if required.
	\n\n
	Electricity is a complex topic and making large working machines requires some learning, but is very satisfying.
	Simple devices however can be constructed by anyone.
	For example, try placing a button next to the hinges of a door.
	You will notice a wire appeared, clicking the button will now operate the door!
	All this scary talk about voltages, signals, digital and analog, but in reality it's that simple.
	\n\n
	Another easy thing to build might be a light switch.
	Place a lightbulb on the ceiling and a switch (not button) on the wall.
	Then connect them with a wire.
	The switch now operates the light, like in a real room!
	\n\n
	Survivalcraft is more about realism than other games of this type, and electricity is no exception.
	What you learn here, might become invaluable when you get to learn this at school, or have to use it for living.
	\n\n
	Explore and have fun!

  <Topic Title="Sleeping">
    Sleeping will help restore your health and pass the boring night hours when it's too dark or dangerous to work.
    \n\n
    Even if you are not hurt, you still need to sleep from time to time.
    If you neglect it, your character will start to have short blackouts.
    If you keep active despite this warning, the blackouts will get longer and eventually you will lose consciousness.
    Losing consciousness is very dangerous, because predatory animals will quickly smell you and feast on your unguarded flesh.
    \n\n
    Although you don't need a bed, you can only sleep in a cosy and comfortable place.
    The ground cannot be too hard and the area cannot be too exposed to the elements, or wet.
    \n\n
    Your respawn point is set to a place where you last slept.
    To sleep, open the body screen and press a little sleeping button.
    \n\n
    Note: Sleeping is disabled in the demo.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Body Temperature">
    When you are out in the cold without proper clothes, your body temperature will drop.
    Your view will start to freeze over and you will start losing health.
    Find a warmer place or get near fire to warm and dry yourself.
    \n\n
    Too much warmth will do you no good either, standing too close to a large fire will cause you to overheat.
    \n\n
    Sheltered areas are warmer than outside.
    Plugging all the holes and locking doors will make a shelter warmer still.
    Even a small hole open to the elements will admit draughts and make a large difference to temperature.
    Make a fire inside your shelter to make it homely warm and allow you to take your clothes off.
    \n\n
    Being wet dramatically increases your susceptibility to cold, find a warm place to dry yourself faster.
    \n\n
    The best way to deal with cold is to wear multiple layers of thick, dry clothes.
    You need to cover your entire body, leaving feet or head unclothed will defeat most of the warming effect other clothes have.
    Clothes made of animal fur are best for keeping cold out.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Clothing">
    Wearing clothing provides warmth in cold climates and armor protection during combat.
    You can access clothing interface by using Clothing button.
    \n\n
    There are 4 clothing slots on your body: head, torso, legs and feet.
    Each slot can have multiple clothing items, layered one on top of each other.
    The effects of multiple clothing items combine.
    \n\n
    Not everything can be worn on top of anything else, for example you will not be able to wear a t-shirt on top of a fur coat.
    \n\n
    Wearing thick clothes in one slot while leaving another slot bare will not afford much warmth.
    It's imperative to cover entire body to really benefit from clothing.
    It's the thinnest piece of clothing that determines how much heat you lose.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Armor">
    Wearing armor or thick clothing will reduce or even completely eliminate combat injuries.
    Armor will absorb the hits, so that they damage the armor instead of injuring your body.
    Once the armor receives too much damage, it will disintegrate.
    \n\n
    When you are attacked, you will randomly receive a hit into one of your four body areas: head, torso, legs or feet.
    If there is no armor at that slot, you will receive full injury, irrespective of how much armor you wear elsewhere.
    By far the most likely area to receive hits is torso, followed by legs.
    Wearing torso armor will stop 60% of hits, torso and legs together will stop 80%.
    Head and feet armor is of less importance, unless you want to be 100% safe.
    \n\n
    The strongest armor is made of iron and diamonds.
    Early in the game, you can craft wooden torso armor from sticks and strings.
    It's not very sturdy but will stand a few hits potentially saving your life.
    \n\n
    Even plain clothes have certain armor value, especially thick ones made of leather and fur.
    They do not stop all hits, but only partially reduce the damage.
    \n\n
    Wearing heavy armor will make you sink to the bottom and drown, be careful around deep water.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Boats">
    Boats can be used to travel across large bodies of water quickly and safely.
    \n\n
    If you don't have a boat, you risk drowning from exhaustion or being attacked by dangerous underwater creatures.
    \n\n
    To craft a boat you need lots of wood and a crafting table.
    Once the boat is crafted, it can be placed on the shore and mounted in the same way as a horse.
    \n\n
    You can only control a boat when it is in the water.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Suicide">
    Sometimes when you are stuck, the only option is suicide, so that you can respawn at your last sleeping place.
    \n\n
    To kill yourself, open the body screen and repeatedly press the skull and bones button.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Dropbox">
    The game uses Dropbox service to allow you to download and upload data to/from your device.
    \n\n
    Through Dropbox, you can backup and share worlds with others.
    You can also download custom blocks textures.
    \n\n
    To login to Dropbox, click on the login button on the Dropbox screen.
    If you don't have a Dropbox account yet, you will be able to setup one during the login.
    \n\n
    Once you log in, the Dropbox screen will show you the contents of your online Dropbox folders, and allow you to download the files to your device.
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="SD Card" DisabledPlatforms="Ios, Windows81, WindowsPhone81, Desktop">
    The game allows you to import and export worlds to SD Card for sharing and backup purposes.
    \n\n
    If your device does not have an SD Card, generic external storage folder will be used.
    The location of the data on the device is normally /sdcard/Survivalcraft
  </Topic>
  <Topic Title="Community Content">
    The game allows you to browse a list of worlds and block textures published by other Survivalcraft community members, and download them.
    \n\n
    Once you build something interesting, you can also publish it through this service, and it will appear on the list for anyone to download.
    \n\n
    To publish something, first you need to put it on the internet, so that it's accessible to everyone.
    The easiest place to use is Dropbox, although you can use any other provider.
    Once it's done, you can publish the link to it through "Publish Link" dialog in the game.
    \n\n
    Note: the server does not store your content, only the link.
    Just like a search engine.
    You are responsible for keeping the data accessible through the published link.
    Watch out for exceeding bandwidth limits of your provider, having a link near top of the list will make your content receive multiple thousands of downloads in a short time.
